Limiting fall time of source v6 to 9.71445e-018
Limiting fall time of source v5 to 9.71445e-018
Limiting fall time of source v4 to 9.71445e-018
Fatal Error: Voltage source V5 and voltage source V6 are paralleled making an over-defined circuit matrix.
You will need to correct the circuit or add some series resistance.
